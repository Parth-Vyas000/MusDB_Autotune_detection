## What is Auto-Tune?
Auto-Tune is a digital effect used to correct pitch in vocal
recordings.


## Why is Auto-Tune Detection Important?
It helps in music forensics, copyright protection, and
AI-generated voice detection.


## Challenges in Detecting Auto-Tuned Vocals
Subtle pitch modifications make detection difficult, and
existing methods rely on manual feature extraction.


## Objective of This Project
Create a labeled dataset and use CNN + LSTM for
automated classification.
